<h2><u>Wildlife Conservation Initiatives by Indian Government</u></h2></font>

  
<p>In 1894, Rudyard Kipling’s famous collection of stories got published and the rest is history. Kipling’s incisive eyes and 6 years of hard work not only created a composition that excited kids but indirectly boasts the rich wildlife in India. Even though it was just a fable it did show the diversity of animals in the country. To really talk about diversity, <mark>India is one of the 17 mega diversities in the world and is home to 7.6% of all mammal, 12.6% of bird, 6.2% of reptile, and 6.0% of flowering plant species.</mark> The country also has some of the most biodiverse regions on the planet and it comprises of four of 35 biodiversity hotspots of the world like the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, Indo-Burma and Nicobar Islands in Sundaland. So far, the country’s wildlife is preserved in 120+ national parks, 515 wildlife sanctuaries, 26 wetlands, and 18 Bio-Reserves, out of which 10 are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. Evidently, this large biodiverse land needs protection, and inarguably conservation is a mandatory measure.</br>==>
Keeping in view the recent human encroachment, the Indian Government did take effective initiatives to conserve wildlife in the country, and amongst it, most commendable initiatives is the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, which prohibits trade of rare and endangered species. However, this is not the only laudatory measure taken by the Government of India (GOI), there is so much more that needs to be told about the schemes and projects that have helped the country maintain its rich wildlife. Here is a glance at the important wildlife conservation initiatives that GOI has taken.</p>
